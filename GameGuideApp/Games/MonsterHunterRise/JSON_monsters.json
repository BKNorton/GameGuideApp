        "Description": "\tAlmudron spends a great deal of time lurking in mud - at least until it emerges to \n\n\tsmother approaching prey. From its tail oozes a strange golden fluid, which Almudron \n\n\tuses to dissolve the ground beneath its prey, arresting them in a mire so that it \n\n\tcan drag them under. When enraged, it produces more fluid, turning the mud golden. \n\n\tWhen you see gold, watch out!",
