		Finish adding all monsters. Format all data.
		Feature ideas

May 17-18

	Created a formating class to create line spaces in strings to format specifically for console output. 
	Tested and all json data file from now on will not need to be formatted in the data
	Removed all special characters from JSON data ex. \n \t

	TODO :
		
		Finishing addding all monsters.
		Use linq queries to search for specific monsters, as well as search alphabetically by first letter of monsters name

	MenuNavigation now uses constructor injection to take in a type that implements IInputController.
	This creates a loose coupling between MenuNavigation and its inputController. If the app needs input that doesn't come from the console,
	then a new inputController that implements IInputController can be switched out. 
	New methods created in FormatController to reduce code.

	TODO :
		
		I do not like Monster and Weapon entities overriding Display. Consider using an interface.
		Finish populating Monster data.
		Create a more flexible way to search through monsters (and other long Entity lists). Potentialy using Linq queries.
