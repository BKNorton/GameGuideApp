# DESCRIPTION
	
	This console app is a game guide to provide the user with useful information for games they are playing.
	This app uses a menu system that allows the user to use number input to select menu options, back out to
	a previous menu, or exit the program. All game data is saved and read from a JSON file. This program is
	designed to be able to add any number of games you would like to. 


# FEATURE LIST

      - Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform   
	actions, including choosing to exit the program.

      - Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use  
	it in your program.

      - Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application.

      - Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent.
